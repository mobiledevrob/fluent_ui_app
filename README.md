# fluent_ui
Implements Fluent UI to flutter. This library can be considered as an alternative to react's fluent ui lib. It's based on the official documentation: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web.

## Motivation
Since flutter has Windows support, it's necessary to have support to its ui guidelines (as it has Material and Cupertino support) to build apps with fidelity.
